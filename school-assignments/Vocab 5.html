                            I was running as fast as I could to escape the person I'd just <u>bilked</u>.
                            Things didn't go the way I planned.
                            In no way did I plan to <u>engender</u> feelings of mistrust.

                            I fell down. The ground is <u>abrasive</u>. My knee is bleeding, and my hands are stinging.
                            I look around for somewhere <u>covert</u> to hide.
                            There is a <u>hangar</u> to my left.
                            I wonder if there is an airplane inside. I could fly a plane.

                            No!
                            I need to focus.
                            I am going off on <u>tangent</u>s.
                            I can't fly a plane.
                            I need to keep looking for somewhere to hide.
                            The guy I'm running from is <u>renown</u> for his ability to see through <u>nuance</u>s.
                            He can tell the difference between twins.

                            I don't know how things got <u>knotty</u> so fast.
                            This problem wasn't even a problem until I <u>plagiarise</u>d the information paragraph.
                            I shouldn't have copied it from the website.
                            That was not smart.
                            It doesn't look like things are going to improve for me anytime soon.
