                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking into the room, I was immediately faced with a <u>dilemma</u> - sit with the guys in the corner in their leather jackets and get into a fight or sit with the girls in the middle of the room wearing their ribbons and <u>incite</u> a fight with the guys in the corner. Neither <u>avenue</u> was great, but I had to make a choice. So, I decided to sit in the middle of the two groups. Unfortunately, looking back, I now cannot <u>enumerate</u> the ways in which this was the worst idea.
                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It started when Maddox came over to ask me about what should have been a <u>lucrative</u> business deal that he went into with me last March. Needless to say, it went south quick, and I owe Maddox a pretty sum of money. Gulping air, I waited for him to swing at me.
                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yo, my main man! What's up?" Maddox asked high-fiving me.
                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was <u>boost</u>ed by his friendly tone, and sat up straighter. "Nothing much. How about you?"
                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh you know, the court declared my marriage to Suzy to be <u>null</u>, because she decided she didn't want to be married to me anymore. And, now, I'm talking to the guy who lost all my money." At this point everyone in the room was looking at us. "I think," Maddox kept talking loudly enough for everyone to hear, "it is my <u>civic</u> duty to <u>annihilate</u> someone like you who ruins lives just for fun. I'd even <u>postulate</u> that no one in this room will stop me."
                        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glanced around and gulped. Needless to say, it wasn't a good day.
