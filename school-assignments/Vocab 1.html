                        Megan <u>endeavour</u>ed to give a speech that would <u>inspire</u> failing students to make "A"s in all their classes.
                        She chose to <u>quote</u> Stephen King, but instead of saying, "Either get busy living or get busy dying," she <u>modifi</u>ed the quote saying, "Either get busy living or get busy dropping out."
                        Megan proceeded to <u>rebuke</u> the students who were failing their classes;
                        she yelled and stomped her foot. 
                        Finally, the principal, who at one point believed Megan was more than <u></u> of giving this speech interrupted her.

                        "I <u>abhor</u> when people stand up and yell into the microphone," he said to the audience.
                        "I would rather speakers be <u>persuasive</u> when giving a speech."
                        The principal continued by encouraging the students to <u>rebel</u> against their desire to not complete their schoolwork and to <u>embark</u> on a new path this year to find success.
