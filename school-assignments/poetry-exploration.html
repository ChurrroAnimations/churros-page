                TP-CASTT Analysis ~ <i>Romance</i> by Edgar Allen Poe
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Title
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                It seems like þe poet might be reflecting on romance as þis intangible or distant concept. Þe þeme is desire.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Paraphrase
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe poet likens romance to a parakeet loafing on a tree branch. 
                Þe weaþer glooms while þe poet is lost in ponder, and þe parakeet beshits him for his epistemic meandering.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Connotation
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe poem might mean þe time þe poet spent being in love &mdash; assumably squandering þe opportunity xor his attempts going bearing futile &mdash; has ultimately lead to hardship.
                Þe bird could point towards þe former scenario, wherein þe poet squandered þe opportunity, seeing how it rests on a branch.
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe repetition of rhyming pairs at þe end of þe word in þe first stanza could suggest how his loving would end in a growingly predictable but relatively simple end.
                Þe more interwoven rhymes of þe second stanza could suggest how þe poet's life became more difficult and how þey keep returning to reflect upon þis time þey lost.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Attitude
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe poet's tone seems to be one of reflection, regret, a nascent feeling of inexoribility towards þis outcome, as shown by &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;my very earliest word&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;, &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;forbidden things&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;with tomult as they thunder by&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Shift
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þere is a noticable shift between þe first and second stanzas.
                Þe first reads as young and ignorant, while þe second transition to more stricken and glum.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Title
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe þeory of þis poem's title was off, seeming to bo more about romance as þis item þe poet spend so much time lost in, it ultimately bescumbered all else.
            </p>
            <p class="tp h">
                Þeme.
            </p>
            <p class="tp">
                Þe þeme of þe poem appears to be
                <u>fantasizing romance leads to grief</u>.

                The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats
            </p>
            <p>
                I initially chose þis poem for reasons þat I'll just leave at <i>unprofessional</i>.
                When returning to þe poem, tis clearly case as a reference to þe religious belief of Jesus returning to Earth, whoops.
                In þe first verse, it describes þis lawless time. In þe second verse, it introduces þis religious belief of The Second Coming in þis aforesaid lawless time.
                However, some of þe lines don't do my inital reason for choosing þis poem any justice, such as &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;full of passionate intensity&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;moving its slow thigh&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;.
            </p>

                A Dog Has Died by Pablo Neruda
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a dark sense of humour; and a song I like is <i>Dead Puppies</i> by Bill Frenzer.
                I like þis poem as it adds anoþer perespective to þat of Dead Puppies, albiet slighly more bleak.
                Þe poet recalls how he loved his dog and þe memories he made wiþ him.
            </p>
            <p class="h">
                Who Said It was simple by Audre Lorde
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose þis poem because
                A) I am AuDHD and have a tendancy to overcomplicate þings.
                And B) I remember we looked at one of Audre Lorde's speeches last semster and I really resonate wiþ her work.
                Þe poet describes herself in a civil rights movement and describes þe inequalities þey face, even while at þe rally.

                A Young Gild With a Pitcher Full of Water by David Wagoner
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose it because I am a transgender woman who is prevented from medically transition due to þe government.
                And I find gender euphoria in imagining myself as þe protagonist.
                Of whom in þe poem carries a full water pitcher þrough þe house, out þe front door and to a patch of flowers she waters.

                I disagree wiþ þe þeme.
                I've only really felt attracted to fictional monsters &mdash; namely þe Demogorgon and þe Deathclaw.
                Writing erotica and fantasies about þem has actually helped me.
                Writing and fantasies can be a source of gender euphoria for transgender individuals.
                For me, writing has helped me figure out who I am and gives me a place to be who I truly am sans arbitrary restrictions.
                My writing is a place I can be who I am wiþout restraint, which can be a source of gender euphoria for transgender individuals, and is for me.
