                        Normally, she tried to maintain <u>Impartiality</u> and not relay what was going to happen in the future to the people around her, but this time what was going to happen was too <u>egregious</u> to ignore.
                        The criminal reacted with <u>ferocity</u> when the police came to his door.
                        He was <u>entrenched</u>.
                        He tried to escape, but the girl was <u>omnipotent</u> and she knew what all his actions would be as she changed the direction of the future.
                        The town was pleased that the girl helped them avoid an event that would have caused them to <u>lament</u>, and even as the criminal screamed the girl with her power was the problem, the girl was too <u>momentous</u> in the town for them to turn against her.
