                        When Ryan went to rob the bank, he wore his <b>talisman</b> ~ a lucky necklace.
                        He drove slowly over the bridge spanning the <b>placid</b> lake, and the look of the calm water calmed him.
                        He felt he was right in stealing from the <b>bigot</b> who was his boss.
                        The man refused to give him <b>remuneration</b> for the work he did.
                        His boss did not agree with <b>enfranchis</b>ing people "like him."
                        That is why Ryan first <b>kindle</b>d the fire the other night.
                        Unfortunately, starting fires wasn't his <b>aptitude</b>, and before any damage could be done, his flame burned out.
                        It was <b>hampered</b>ed by the rainy weather.
                        Today, he had a different plan.
                        He was going to replace the hundred-dollar bills in the safe with <b>counterfeit</b> bills.
                        Then, he was going to leave town to never be seen again.
                        His plan would have worked too, if after he crossed the bridge over the lake he hadn't hit the tanker with the <b>noxious</b> liquid.
                        As he lost consciousness, he saw the poison symbol on the side of the truck.
