            <h1>Churro's Mental Health</h1>
            <p>
                I try my best to not burden other people with my problems.
                I had a rough ride in September and the start of October.
                Mental health isn't very easy, but one way I've found that helps me guage how I am doing is with this; a modified version of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionaire-9),
                which I've dubbed the Churro Health Questionaire-9, or CHQ-9".
                <b>
                    Please know, this is not an official diagnosis. This is simply a tool designed to help me understand, express, and record how I am doing.
                </b>
                Below are my responses to this form, being last update 17 Sep 2025.

            <p>
                In September, I had a severe dysphoric crisis, leading to self harm.
                At the start of October, I admitted myself to the CRC solely in not wanting to die, not caring about my self harm nor feeling much of anything.
                But I've grown stronger and more confident as a result of surviving.
                I also can's help but feel like I've 9 or 10 months, because it took about 9 months of figuring out my sexuality to reach a breaking point with it and move onto my gender. 
                Then it took 10 months for another breaking point with my dysphoric crisis.
                But I know that timeline is pretty skewed and my brain is trying to find patterns. 
                And transgender and queer travellers have always been here, so I know I will make it.
                And I've plenty of spite and resentment to capitulate my opponents and show the world who we are.
                Because fuck you, my deadname is Aidan, A-I-D-A-N, and today, I am a woman and my name is Tuesday.
