            <p>
                I try my best to not burden other people with my problems.
                But I am not doing okay right now, nor have I been for a while.
                I am working on it and trying to be okay, but it's not easy.
                One way I've found that helps me guage how I am doing is with a modified version of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionaire-9),
                which I've dubbed the Churro Health Questionaire-9, or CHQ-9".
                <b>
                    Please know, this is not an official diagnosis. This is simply a tool designed to help me understand, express, and record how I am doing.

            <p>
                Also at the start of this month of September, I had a mild crisis.
                I was feeling frustrated with my computer, and that frustration was very dysphoria inducing.
                And for some reason, I just devolved into a puddle.
                All my coping mechanisms for dealing with day to day dysphoria just crumbled.
                When people deadname you, or use the wrong pronouns, but quickly correct themselves or you correct them, or someone else corrects them, that dyphoria doesn't simply go away.
                Whether you realise it or not, it does stay with you.
                And I can clearly recount the numerous times this has happened.
                For some reason, on this particular night, it all just came crumpling down.
                I just curled in a ball and wished for it all to go away. 
                I didn't want to deal with living this life.
                Just for a day.
                But I know that's not something you can simply come back from after a day.
                I was very close to calling the CRC, and I probably should have at that moment.
