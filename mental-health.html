            <p>
                I try my best to not burden other people with my problems.
                But I am not doing okay right now, nor have I been for a while.
                I am working on it and trying to be okay, but it's not easy.
                One way I've found that helps me guage how I am doing is with a modified version of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionaire-9),
                which I've dubbed the Churro Health Questionaire-9, or CHQ-9".
                <b>
                    Please know, this is not an official diagnosis. This is simply a tool designed to help me understand, express, and record how I am doing.

            <p>
                Also at the start of this month of September, I had a mild crisis.
                I was feeling frustrated with my computer and I really wanted to swear profusely and bang my fists, which I found extremely dysphoria inducing.
                It wasn't the first time I've had these feelings.
                But for some reason, all my coping mechanisms for dealing with it simply shut down and all this mixed dysphoria just came crashing down.
                When someone deadnames you, uses the wrong pronouns, misgenders you, it's really dysphoria inducing.
                Even if it's a mistake and they correct themselves, or someone else corrects them or you correct them, whether you realise it or not, the dysphoria stays with you.
                I remember several times where I've been called the wrong name and they correct themselves, I still remember it.
                And at this moment with all this dysphoria, I just didn't want to deal with living this life, even for day, and then I'd come back and everything would be fine.
                Except that's not something you can come back from and everything would still be far from fine.
                I considering getting a knife, but I was scared.
                I was close to dialling the CRC and I probably should have in that moment.
                I didn't, again, because I was scared.
