                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    It seem like the video game market is oversaturated, with millions of developers and even more games.
                    And only a percentage of that achieve major success.
                    Not to mention large companies like EA and Nintendo that can seemingly produce household names overnight.

                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    I find this vast sea of the video market discouraging.
                    Additionally I don't want to spend a large part of my life working on one thing.
                    So I am not going to turn my visions into reality
                    However, my indecisions shouldn't limit future generations.
                    I've compiled my thoughts to empower young game developers.
                    Feel free to use these ideas and make something even greater.

                        This is a project I made on Scratch a while ago, and started a complete overhaul of it adding a bunch more content. 
                        Though after a while I got burnt out. 
                        Then I started looking towards other programming languages and trying different things and I abandoned it.

                        There is an eevee named Calamity. She loves you and wil follow you to the ends of the earth.
                        There are lasers for some reason and you must lure her away from the lazers and survive as long as possible.
                        When calamity gets hit with a laser, she dumps you. 
                        Except you're stuck in a time loop so Calamity just comes right back to you and you start the cycle over.
                        There are shops with clerks that look suspiciously similar to Calamity.

                        The player is a Pokémon trainer who had an eevee that died in a battle and now they're stuck in hell forced to relive that day forever.
                        And Calamity is in control of it.

                        You are simply thrown into the game, no story, no prior cutscenes, no tutorial or anything telling you what to do.
                        You should feel in a position similar to the creature you play as; confused, frustrated, overwhelmed, uncertain, etc.

                        The gameplay does not have any textual story, only visual indicators — statues, structures, paintings, sculptures, etc — letting the player come up with their own idea of what happened.

                        However instead of gaining new powers, you lose them over time.
                        You are trying to find a way out to the surface.

                        You can visually see how the world changes over time.
                        It is supposed to show the player how fast time seems to go and how short life is, so make the most of it.
