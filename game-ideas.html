                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    It seems like there is an oversaturation in the market of video games;
                    there are millions of game developers and even more video games and a percentage of that develops a large community around it.
                    And even fewer make it very far.
                    Especially with companies like Nintendo and EA that seemingly produce household names overnight.

                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    And I find this vast sea of the videogame market discouraging, and why, in part too that I don't want to spend a large chunk of my life on a singular project, I am not going to make any of these a reality.
                    I've compiled a list of ideas I've had for games in hopes I can inspire someone else to take my ideas and make something even better than the vision I was too scared to realize.

                        You are a small white creature who awakes in a deep cave, a small hole above in the ceiling lets the moonlight fill the room.
                        You are simply thrown into the game, no story, no prior cutscenes, no tutorial or anything telling you what to do.
                        You should be in a position similar to the creature you play as; confused, frustrated, overwhelmed, uncertain, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                        It should be clear to you that the creature you play as is part of an intelligent species that have developed a complex civilization.
                        The gameplay does not have any textual story, only background elements, statues, structures, tools, drawings and paintings, etc.
                        You are to come up with your own thoughts as to what happened.

                    <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                        The main difficulty is that you start with all your abilities — dashing, wall climbing, double jumping, the whole lot — and, instead of gaining new powers, you actually lose them, flipping the conventional leveling up system on its head.

                        A walking simulator style game with the only controls being movement. 
                        You play as a turtle who lives through several hundred years, from birth to death.
                        You can visually see how the world changes over time.
                        It is supposed to show the player how fast time seems to go and how short life is, so make the most of it.

                        This is not even a game, though it costs a few bucks.
                        It literally opens a black window with text telling you there is nothing.
                        There is a narrator that tells you there is literally no game, and will ocassionally chime in and remind you of this.
                        After 2 full days(48 hours) of having the window open, you get an achievement, the only achievement in the program.
                        This is satirical and meant to illustrate how you can publish just about anything and call it a game.
