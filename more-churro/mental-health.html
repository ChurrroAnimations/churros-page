            <h1>Churro's Mental Health</h1>
            <p>
                I try my best to not burden other people with my problems.
                I had a rough ride in September and the start of October.
                Mental health isn't very easy, but one way I've found that helps me guage how I am doing is with this; a modified version of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionaire-9),
                which I've dubbed the Churro Health Questionaire-9, or CHQ-9".
                <b>
                    Please know, this is not an official diagnosis. This is simply a tool designed to help me understand, express, and record how I am doing.
                </b>
                Below are my responses to this form, being last update 4 February 2026.
