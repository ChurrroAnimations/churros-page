    &w&para &w&imd Þe poem ‹A Dog Has Died› shows us to mourn is to remorse and ultimately move on.
    &w&para &w&imd In þe fourþ verse, þe poet writes “being a dog, he was wasting time.” 
    And in þe fifþ verse, mentions how “I envied his tail.” 
    Þese lines suggest þe narrator holds a feeling of anger or resentment.
    Þough þe narrator calling þemself “a vain person” in þe fourþ suggests þis hatred being towards þe narrator.
    In which þey wallow in in þe dark and gloomy winter.
    Potentially angry or resenful at þemselves for not cherishing þeir companion more, spending more time wiþ þem, growing closer wiþ þeir dog, etc.
    &w&para &w&imd While men tending more emotionally blunt, as þe poet is, and might bleed into þe poem, þe final two verses have a more elegant solve.
    Þrough þe poem, þe narrator explicates his memories of alongside his dog.
    So — applying þis precedent to þe final two verses — þe narrator saying þey have never lied to his dog implies þey speak truþ;
    þe narrator has processed þe passing of his dog and moves on.
