TwTitel:‹Drawing a daily toe potato day 320›

First and foremost it's quite clear looking through my posts that saying I've been drawing something every day for the past 320 days is a lie, and it's not even a potato with toes coming out of it anymore. It's basically just me drawing whatever I want whenever I want. And "drawing a daily toe potato" is quite misleading. So I'm going to stop doing it. I'm going to do something similar, but I'm probably going to call it something else and it's going to be less frequent, but more thoughtful. 
Second thing, while I accept the fact that Trump won the presidency, I am still going up speak my mind and be myself. I don't like that he's the president, and I'm certainly not going to condone, for lack of a better word, a monster. You know what, no, Trump is a monster. I have friends who are immigrants, who are trans, who are women, and I will support them. I am agender, and I like wearing feminine clothes and I do find myself romantically attracted to men at times. I am not going to stand up for the pledge of allegiance because I am not going to pledge my allegiance to a monster. If you don't like any part of this, there is a block button, use it, because I don't care.
