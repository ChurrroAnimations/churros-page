                    Churro is a well-loved plushie.
                    His fabric a once rich and vibrant deep green colour now faded, complimented by a lighter green underbelly.
                    Chipped and beady eyes, devoid of emotion.
                    Seated on either side of their squished dome head, apart whilst telling a unison story.
                    A field of underbelly green spanning the two with a derpy V-shaped maw equidistant.

                    Churro's fur a scratchy and worn fabric.
                    A far cry from its prime, yet seldom soft, providing an allure unto.
                    His stuffing deflated and tough howbeit plump and airy.
                    His features providing condolence and comfort just the same.

                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Churro speaks in soothing and melodic form.
                    Uttered in perfect tongue, though of undecipherable androgyny.
                    His voice analogous to that of a young child.

                    An air of mystery and unease stemming from his inexplicable origins accompanies Churro's presence.
                    Yet he poses insubstantial threat, presenting as though harmless and gentle.
                    Churro's sole reason for willing himself into existence is offer hugs to those consenting.
                    Churro prefers to observe from afar, inquiring about your views on hugs, nothing more.

                    Churro is a stuffed animal, making him very flammable and susceptible to attacks.
                    Churro is able to regrow any damage he's sustained, due to his ability to shape shift.
                    Churro can perfectly replicate any object, however he still feels soft and squishy to the touch.

                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag" id="">
                    Churro is a extranatural entity that willed himself into existence during February of 2024.
                    Churro's origins prior is entirely unknown.
                    Ergo, trying to accurately quantify his age is like that of Sisyphus' story, whereby it is futile.

                    Physical description
                </h3>
                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Sopapilla's body is on the smaller side when compared to other RainWings her age, but quite stout in build.
                    Inversely, her wings are slightly oversized, boasting a considerable wingspan.
                    These features in tandem convey a somewhat comical silhouette.
                </p>
                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Sopapilla's scales are a muted pear green with undertones of cerulean blue.
                    Her underbelly is an aged mint green, seeming as though stained with sepia.
                    Her wings are a vibrant fuchsia that fades to a dappled hot pink.
                    Sopapilla's eyes are a dark off-amber yellow color.

                    Personality
                </h3>
                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Sopapilla likes to keep to herself and stay out of trouble, though likes to wander off frequently.
                    She rarely meets new dragons on her own, and isn't expectant of others to get to know her.
                    But Sopapilla is pretty outgoing when others approach her.

                    Strengths and weaknesses
                </h3>
                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Sopapilla is pretty pathetic in battle, and chooses to flee rather than fight face to face.
                    She is an extremely fast and agile flier and could easily outfly any opponent.
                    However, Sopapilla's abilities in a fight are limited due to her fear of flying.
                    In fact, she avoids flying altogether, opting to walk and climb to get around.
                    Sopapilla is very empathetic and likes giving random people hugs.
                    She feels very insecure towards her fear of flying and towards her adopted parents.
                    Sopapilla is also able to grasp concepts pretty quickly.

                    Backstory
                </h3>
                <p class="subsectionText subsectionParag">
                    Sopapilla was abandoned as an egg and adopted by a rainwing throuple of a mother and two non binary parents.
                    Sopapilla was often bullied: sometimes about her parents, but most often it was that she preferred to climb while her peers were flying circles around her.
                    At a really young age, Sopapilla and her friends decided to race around the forest.
                    But she got lost in MudWing territory and attacked.
                    One of Sopapilla's friends helped Sopapilla flee from her MudWing attacker.
                    However, this was the last time she saw her friend.
