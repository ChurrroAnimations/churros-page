        <meta name="description" content="Basic information
        Species: Dragon (RainWing)
        Gender: Cis female (she/her)
        Sexuality: Ace
        Age: 6.5 dragon years (about 17-18 in human years)
Physical description
        Sopapilla's body is on the smaller side when compared to other RainWings her age, but quite stout in build. Inversely, her wings are slightly oversized, boasting a considerable wingspan. These features in tandem convey a somewhat comical silhouette.
        Sopapilla's scales are a muted pear green with undertones of cerulean blue. Her underbelly is a somewhat aged mint green, looking almost as though stained with sepia. Her wings are a vibrant fuchsia that fades to a dappled hot pink. Sopapilla's eyes are a dark off-amber yellow color.
Personality
        Sopapilla likes to keep to herself and try to stay out of trouble, though likes to wander off frequently. She rarely meets new people on her own, and isn't expectant of others to get to know her. But Sopapilla is pretty outgoing when others want to talk to her.
Strengths and weaknesses
        Sopapilla is pretty pathetic in battle, and chooses to flee rather than fly. She is an extremely fast and agile flier and could easily outfly any opponent. However, Sopapilla is afraid of flying, so she opts to walk and climb to get around. Sopapilla is very empathetic and likes giving random people hugs. She feels very insecure towards her fear of flying and towards her adopted parents. She is also able to grasp concepts pretty quickly.
Backstory
        Sopapilla was abandoned as an egg and adopted by a RainWing throuple of a mother and two non binary parents. Sopapilla was often bullied: sometimes about her parents, but most often it was that she preferred to climb while her peers were flying circles around her. At a really young age, Sopapilla and her friends decided to race around the forest. But she got lost in MudWing territory and attacked. One of Sopapilla's friends helped Sopapilla flee from her MudWing attacker, but at the cost of his life." />
