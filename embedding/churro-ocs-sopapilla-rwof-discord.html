                    <b><u>Preffered Dorm:</u></b>
                    Would like to be with a derg whose ideals and personality are opposite to hers, but is fine with any so long as it isn't another RainWing.
                    Not that Sopapilla has anything major against other RainWings, she just strongly believes she'd do better with her studies with a derg with a significantly different background and perspective to hers.

                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Abilities:</u></b>
                    Rainwing venom, color changing scales

                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Physical description:</u></b>
                    Sopapilla's body is rather small in comparison to other rainwings her age, but stout in build.
                    In stark contrast, her wings are slightly oversized, bearing a considerable wingspan.
                    These features in tandem convey a somewhat comical silhouette. 
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift subsectionParag" style="margin-top:-10px">
                    Sopapilla's scales are a slightly muted pear green with a subtle cerulean blue undertone, while her underbelly is an aged mint green, as though stained with sepia.
                    Her wings are a vibrant fuchsia that fades to a dappled hot pink.
                    Sopapilla's eyes are a dark yellow.
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Personality:</u></b>
                    Sopapilla likes to keep to herself and try to stay out of trouble, though likes to wander off frequently.
                    She rarely meets new people on her own, and isn't expectant of others to get to know her.
                    But Sopapilla is pretty outgoing when others want to talk to her. 
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Weaknesses:</u></b>
                    Sopapilla is pretty pathetic at one on one combat, and flees rather than fight.
                    Sopapilla is afraid of flying (see Backstory for details), and sticks to walking/climbing.
                    Very insecure about herself with her fear of flying and about her adopted parents. 
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Strengths:</u></b>
                    Extremely fast and agile flier and can outfly just about any opponent(however this strength goes largely unused due to her fear of flying).
                    Sopapilla is very empathetic and likes to give random people a hug.
                    She is very adept at climbing.
                    She also is able to grasp concepts pretty quickly. 
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Why Sopapilla wants to be a student at JMA:</u></b>
                    One of Sopapilla's friends brought it up jokingly and another was like that's a good idea and convinced Sopapilla to go to JMA.
                    And Sopapilla thinks this will be a good experience. 
                </p>
                <p class="subsecTxtNoShift">
                    <b><u>Backstory:</u></b>
                    Sopapilla was abandoned as an egg and adopted by a RainWing throuple of a mother and two non binary parents.
                    Sopapilla was often bullied: sometimes about her parents, but most often it was that she preferred to climb while her peers were flying circles around her.
                    At a really young age, Sopapilla and her friends decided to race around the forest.
                    But she got lost in mudwing territory and attacked.
                    One of Sopapilla's friends helped Sopapilla flee from her MudWing attacker, but at the cost of his life.
