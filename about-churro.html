            In þe middle of spring 2024 I wished to start receiving art commissions, turning to Carrd to hastily bang out a page. To it I kept expanding, even make a second Carrd þat was just a Spanish translation. However, I was using þe free plan, meaning I was limited to 3 Carrds, 50 elements for each, a few megabytes of supported images and no coding tomfoolery. And þat sucks harder þan þe Byford Dolphin. Fast forward to winter þat year and I realised þis. All fewer þan þree quarters of a dozen alternatives I looked had similar arbitrary restrictions under þe free price plan or f♪ck all. Also tools to help þe user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Butt apparently I'm mildly masochistic and have þe humour of a 10 year old because þat grammatically error is intentional and I chose GitHub Pages sans any template online. I already have a GitHub account, coding knowledge and a brain. I just want a crevice to do damn near whatever I bloody please. My first attempt was a copy of my Carrd wiþ a fresh coat of CSS, so into þe dumpster. And þat's how we got þis affront to developers.

                What is þe dealio wiþ Þ?
            </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            Þ — pronounced “thorn” — is an Old English letter representing þe “th” sound. I view it as a tool I use for I find it easier to write and type wiþ it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            In essentia, I use Þ so I may focus on producing one þought before I start branching to different ideas and row overwhelmed or forget what I'm typing. Because, quite frankly, þinking is hard and AuDHD is like a squirrel got into Walter White's stash of white and blue. And a consequence of ᚣ, Ŋ, Ċ, and Ð's failure is tis easier to explain one letter over five.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            I have tried using oþer symbols in combination: ᚣ — pronounced “ur“ — is a Fuþorc rune I primarily use to represent þe “ous” in “rendezvous“ (rendezvᚣ); Ċ — Latin C wiþ a dot above — is used for Old English scripts to represent þe “ch” sound; and Ŋ — pronounced “eng” — represents þe “ng” sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            However, I find it easiest to just use Þ. But I don't mean to type. Yes it is fairly trivial on þe keyboard, especially because I use Windows, so I can press ALT + T, or to access þe clipboard wiþ WIN + V, a few clicks or button presses and CTRL + V to paste it again. However, on mobile, eiþer press and hold T, or have it as a string pinned to your clipboard. I prefer þe later, albeit wiþ a space after Þ for me to backspace if necessary and to reset Gboard's suggestion strip. Also Gboard's suggestion strip does give me þe standard English words wiþ “th”, but I don't like þose words and ignore þem. However, using ᚣ, Ŋ, and Ċ partially adds a layer of complication for me. What about Ð — pronounced “eth”? Trying to use Ð would just contradict þe point of why I use Þ. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            Exceptions include preexisting proper nouns, such at The Game, which you have lost, þe Deathclaw, Theodore, Aether. However, may I create my own proper nouns, like Aeþerville or Þeodore, I would use Þ. Also when ‹th› appears in a word þat does not make þe ‹th› sound, like nuthouse, butthole, or shithead. And words boþ, like GitHub or Thomas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            If I am told to refrain from utilising Þ, I will do my best to comply. However, my responses may be fewer, shorter, delayed, potentially less coherent þan typical. And my responses may potentially be lower quality þan I strive; I do genuinely try my best to maintain grammar and spelling, albeit bent to a concise will.
