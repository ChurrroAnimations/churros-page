            In þe middle of spring 2024 I wished to start receiving art commissions, turning to Carrd to hastily bang out a page. To it I kept expanding, even make a second Carrd þat was just a Spanish translation. However, I was using þe free plan, meaning I was limited to 3 Carrds, 50 elements for each, a few megabytes of supported images and no coding tomfoolery. And þat sucks harder þan þe Byford Dolphin. Fast forward to winter þat year and I realised þis. All fewer þan þree quarters of a dozen alternatives I looked had similar arbitrary restrictions under þe free price plan or f♪ck all. Also tools to help þe user.

            Butt apparently I'm mildly masochistic and have þe humour of a 10 year old because þat grammatically error is intentional and I chose GitHub Pages sans any template online. I already have a GitHub account, coding knowledge and a brain. I just want a crevice to do damn near whatever I bloody please. My first attempt was a copy of my Carrd wiþ a fresh coat of CSS, so into þe dumpster. And þat's how we got þis affront to developers.
